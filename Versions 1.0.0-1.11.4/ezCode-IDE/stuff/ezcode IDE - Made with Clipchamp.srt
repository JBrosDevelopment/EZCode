1
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:05,884
OK, welcome to.The 

2
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:08,104
store we're going to be learning how to 

3
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:09,994
use easy code editor.

4
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:13,684
So I'll just go over each thing so this 

5
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,154
has the top bar right here.This 

6
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:18,894
has all of these. This is the main 

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,264
navigation for this IDE.

8
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:24,524
This is the project list.This will 

9
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,094
have.You can have a bunch of files right 

10
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:29,484
here and go between them easily.

11
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:32,954
This is the visualizer output.

12
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:35,304
Or box?

13
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:38,574
Um, this is the 

14
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,284
console. This is the console input so 

15
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,184
where you can send it and this is what 

16
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:44,684
clears the console.This is the 

17
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:48,254
debugger. This will show all of the 

18
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:51,134
variables when you align by line. We'll 

19
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:52,654
get to that later.So we'll just 

20
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:54,714
start with.

21
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:59,264
And you can see here it prints it right 

22
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:00,304
there.Good.

23
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,474
Label high.Doesn't 

24
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:07,534
print it out right there, but it will 

25
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,174
put it right here. So this is the 

26
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,414
visual, this is the console.

27
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:14,424
Um.We'll go 

28
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,844
with this first. So this has 

29
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:22,004
an auto save function. This will save 

30
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,694
every time you type. Every time you type 

31
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,014
a key on the keyboard it saves the file.

32
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,854
This will save the file. This opens file 

33
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,074
new pretty self-explanatory undo 

34
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:33,594
redo.This can 

35
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:37,504
open a project list, so a project 

36
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,164
list will store.

37
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,054
Files inside of here, so let me.

38
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,094
Add some files to there.

39
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,354
Here's some files so we can quickly go 

40
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,634
between them. We'll put on autosave.

41
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,434
And we can quickly go between.

42
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:00,174
Different files.

43
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,154
And if I save this project list, it'll 

44
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,614
save it to a file that I can 

45
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:08,894
then open up later, and then I can 

46
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,574
also remove a file from the list. So 

47
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,434
this will start with an index, this being

48
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,134
 01234.

49
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:18,534
If I put in two it should remove the 

50
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:20,694
plaque click dot Easy code.And it does 

51
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,364
so.Then you have 

52
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:27,014
auto open project so this.

53
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,924
This has a.

54
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:35,034
It's putting a you are a a file URL or a 

55
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,124
file directory right here 

56
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,704
and every time you open up the editor 

57
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,644
it'll open up this. If you want it to 

58
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,334
stop doing that you can clear project 

59
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,824
list.And it'll be empty again 

60
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,964
and also package which will open up the 

61
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:51,934
easy code packaging.We we won't need to 

62
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:53,704
do that. Now that's pretty self-

63
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:55,484
explanatory too.So this is the 

64
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,084
debug function if I 

65
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,944
put let me create a small script real 

66
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:01,744
quick.

67
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,204
We go, we go into debug. 

68
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,244
So right here it shows the line 

69
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,384
that we're on.Next line 

70
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,384
has var a hello.And it 

71
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,114
puts this right here so a is equal to 

72
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:28,234
hello and then it has print A and then 

73
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:29,694
right here you can see.Next 

74
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:32,704
line.Says high in the hell 

75
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,864
what it should do, but you can do it 

76
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:37,644
line by line. That's how the debugger 

77
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:40,074
works. So this is the quid debugger and 

78
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,904
next line.You also play it all at 

79
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,404
once.Which will just play it 

80
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:47,594
immediately, stop it and play in viewer. 

81
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,604
This will open up the easy code viewer.

82
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:52,414
And.Already to this file, but that's 

83
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,654
also pretty self-explanatory. We won't 

84
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,264
go over that.This will 

85
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,134
open up the docks.

86
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,274
Um for on the easy code 

87
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,374
website and then this will show you all 

88
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:05,944
the hot keys.And go over that 

89
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:08,344
either.That is.

90
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:12,734
Pretty much it this will one more thing 

91
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:15,434
and here if you have objects and labels, 

92
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,574
this will show all the objects it's 

93
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:20,564
positions and stuff as values. This will 

94
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,814
show all the labels, its positions and 

95
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,374
values.And so 

96
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:28,074
that's it for the easy code editor. 

97
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:30,270
Hope you learned something from this.
