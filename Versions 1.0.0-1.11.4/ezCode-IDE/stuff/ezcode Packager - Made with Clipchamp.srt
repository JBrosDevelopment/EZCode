1
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,937
OK, welcome to this soil. We're going to 

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,287
learn how to use easy cooked packager.

3
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:09,837
So.First things 

4
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:13,307
first.You have to get your 

5
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:15,957
project directory.So I'm going to open 

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:18,427
folder.And my project 

7
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:22,157
directory directory is right there. 

8
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:23,075
So 

9
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:26,848
Second step is open your startup 

10
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:27,998
file.Startup 

11
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:31,338
file is.Right 

12
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:33,398
there.Then your 

13
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:37,258
output folder, I'm going to output it to 

14
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:38,508
desktop.Alright, I'm gonna 

15
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,498
leave the author unknown, but the 

16
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,238
company is.

17
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:49,638
Beavers Development.

18
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,378
Package might call it.

19
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,718
Alright, package 

20
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:06,038
successfully packaged, so now we can 

21
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:07,646
exit out of that.And here it is.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,600
OK, so if you also have your project.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,460
On Easy Code you can 

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,160
click Package and I'll ask you if it's 

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,020
installed.I haven't installed 

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,600
and you find the directory.

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,690
And it'll open it up.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,751
Alright, that's it. Hope you learned.
