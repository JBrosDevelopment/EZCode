1
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,921
In the straw we will learn how to use 

2
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:07,991
Easy Code Viewer.Pretty pretty 

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,661
simple. So you have an 

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,631
open, we'll open a file, exit, so 

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,301
Start Stop and this just shows the 

6
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:19,041
viewer and then the languages version.

7
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:22,791
This is the visualizer box. 

8
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:24,821
This is the.Console 

9
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,171
and this is the console input and that's 

10
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:29,621
the send button.What we'll do here 

11
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,291
is we'll open a file.

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,601
Open up pong, for example.

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,111
And what play?

14
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,441
And it'll take your input.

15
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:46,591
And it'll play it.Account for 

16
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:48,971
teacher.And we'll just 

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,791
stop this for now.

18
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,751
If you have a program that takes.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,510
Sorry, this took a second to find the 

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,660
file. Um, we can move this 

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,410
up.And this 

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,140
is the multiplication generator after 

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,140
that.And it worked just like this. 

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,260
It's pretty straightforward. Now this 

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,570
works. There's one more thing though, if 

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,460
we move this go into here.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,490
And you want to play a file in the 

28
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,110
viewer.Versus open file.

29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,430
We will open Pong.

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,630
And we put Play play viewer.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,780
It will open up the viewer with it 

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,570
already loaded in.And if it's your first 

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,920
time doing it.And it'll ask you 

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,770
questions, and it'll ask you.

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,380
And if it's your first time doing it, 

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,370
it'll ask you where.

37
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,150
If you haven't installed and where it is 

38
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,090
located.And then 

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,160
every time after that it'll 

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,340
automatically open it for you.

41
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,730
So.That 

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,190
is, that is it for this video. Hope you 

43
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,278
learned something.
