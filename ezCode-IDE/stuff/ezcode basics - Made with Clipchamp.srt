00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:04,915
Welcome to the basic tutorial on how to 

2
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:05,925
use easy code.

3
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,965
Let's first just start off with the 

4
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:13,425
language. So we'll start with Hello 

5
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:14,655
World.

6
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,475
Play it. See Hello right here.

7
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,385
Now if I put print raw.

8
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:29,215
Of the world.You 

9
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:32,805
get Hello World.

10
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,165
Can't do this though.

11
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,115
Because the print function only prints 1 

12
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,635
space in front.So what you'll 

13
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,265
do is you use.

14
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:48,105
Space character which is a back slash.

15
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:53,915
Back slash and then this so print it and 

16
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,715
it prints hello world like this.

17
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,285
So that's just kind of how the language 

18
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,745
works. It's divided by spaces.

19
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,125
So next thing we'll do.As 

20
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:08,545
we'll make a small little project.

21
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:12,605
All right. So first we'll print.

22
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:14,805
Draw.

23
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,465
Welcome to the mold.

24
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:23,215
Case in table.

25
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:28,695
Prince Royal.

26
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:37,295
Please enter a number to generate.

27
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,275
Right. And you see these?

28
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,445
Now we'll add a variable, so that's the 

29
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:57,625
var.And 

30
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:01,595
call it number.And it will be 

31
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:04,645
read by console input.

32
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,875
So now the test will just print number. 

33
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,655
This will do is it'll wait for you to 

34
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:13,835
input.

35
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,725
And it and it prints right here.

36
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:21,935
That's just a test now.

37
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,795
What we'll need to do is.

38
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:30,108
Creates A variable named.

39
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:32,328
R in.And we'll sign it 

40
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:36,168
to number. This will be the resetting 

41
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,948
variable. This will set number back.

42
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:41,808
You you'll see in a second.So 

43
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,448
now we'll create a 

44
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,778
variable to.

45
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,318
That will be printed.That has the 

46
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:53,428
inputted number, so we'll have what's 

47
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:54,788
called text.

48
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:10,278
Undo text.

49
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:12,158
Yes.

50
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:15,438
Number.

51
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:19,998
Text Plus.

52
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:22,928
Pulling tanks.

53
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:25,448
Plus.

54
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:31,488
Text.Now we put in our 

55
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:34,058
number.And multiplication 

56
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,728
table for five 4.5.

57
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:44,028
Now what we'll do is.

58
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:49,788
We'll create some variables, so var 

59
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,618
multiplier.

60
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,868
And it will be equal to

61
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,268
 1 because that's the first number of 

62
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:00,748
multiplication.Are 

63
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,198
what's called a now, and 

64
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:07,238
it'll be set to nothing and bar.

65
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:10,078
Results. Right now they'll just be set 

66
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:11,848
to number.How about your 

67
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:14,948
league 10 times?

68
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,168
Start by doing is 

69
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,368
set number.T

70
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:25,668
ORN.

71
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,098
This will reset 

72
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:32,398
the we'll use number later and this will 

73
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,658
reset the numbers value back to the 

74
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:35,718
original input.

75
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,788
Will make sure a is 

76
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:43,328
equal to nothing again.

77
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:48,208
And we'll make results back to number.

78
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,418
So these just reset those 3 variables.

79
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,308
Now what we'll do is we'll do results 

80
00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,698
is equal is.

81
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,818
Multiplied by the multiplier.

82
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:06,528
And you'll see the multiplier will be 

83
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,758
added. We'll add 1 to multiply.

84
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,008
Now in this loop.

85
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,398
And we will.

86
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,208
Prince results.

87
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,518
And so you see it will have This has 

88
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:31,488
errors in it, but.This right here 

89
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:33,398
has.The 

90
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,228
multiplication table is now.We'll 

91
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,248
finish this.I 

92
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:41,558
put in.

93
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,168
Here's all spelled correctly.

94
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,018
Alright, we'll put.A

95
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,038
+ number.

96
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,378
A+ space.

97
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,838
8 plus.

98
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,488
Multiplier.A 

99
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:11,758
plus.

100
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,018
Other space.8 plus.

101
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:25,378
Equals A plus.

102
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:27,678
Results.

103
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,508
And then we will.It's.

104
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,238
But what I'm through 9.

105
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:43,958
I forgot.

106
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:48,878
One more A+ space.

107
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:50,798
9.

108
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:56,838
A.

109
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,568
So that'll fix that, and then what is 

110
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:06,968
the error that's happening?

111
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,198
So that fixes the.

112
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:23,048
Space is now What is the air that's 

113
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:23,738
happening?

114
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:30,338
Right there.Groupon equal 

115
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:32,478
sign.

116
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,828
Three enter So this is what we 

117
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,228
have. Welcome welcome to the 

118
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,158
multiplication table. Please enter your 

119
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:43,418
number to generate multiplication 

120
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:45,378
table for three. Then 3 * 1 three

121
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:48,418
 3 * 2 six 3 * 3 is 9 and 

122
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,018
so on.And then what we'll 

123
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:53,438
do here is we'll put a nice 

124
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:55,208
little thank you.

125
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,848
And there we go.Now 

126
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,428
let's try using.

127
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:26,568
The visual output right here 

128
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:28,868
we'll do is we'll create.

129
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,308
Text box.

130
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:33,858
Name it.

131
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:44,638
Text input.

132
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,728
So that's text and nothing. So now you 

133
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,268
see we have this.

134
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,928
Visual output. We'll create a label and 

135
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:55,538
we'll name it text.

136
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:04,968
OK, now we'll create.

137
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:09,148
Variable set to nothing right now.

138
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,448
And then we'll move.

139
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,668
Text output to label.

140
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:19,808
Below the.

141
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:23,248
Below the text box.

142
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,278
So we'll loop just pretty much forever.

143
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:34,048
And we will await every loop. We'll 

144
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,918
wait 250 milliseconds per 

145
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:37,978
second.

146
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:43,208
Now we will put our 

147
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:44,838
equals.

148
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,938
Text and from 

149
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,138
text box modifier 

150
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:52,838
and then we'll put.

151
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,678
Textbox text input. So what this does is 

152
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,028
it sets the variable text 

153
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:02,568
to the to the.Input 

154
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,038
of the text box, text input, 

155
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:07,838
and then we'll end the loop.

156
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,918
One last thing I forgot.All 

157
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:14,968
right.

158
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,478
Text input.

159
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:20,718
Output.

160
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,408
Now put in that.You 

161
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,858
know, copy everything I put in there.

162
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:36,938
Now if I make.

163
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,508
Make.Text input 

164
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,878
multiline and do this again.

165
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:58,598
They will also be multi lined.

166
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:03,738
So I hope this helps you understand the 

167
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:06,818
basics of easy code and the syntax and 

168
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:08,028
how it works.
