00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,964
Alright, welcome to This Tutorial. Now 

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:07,074
we'll learn how to use Easy Codes 

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:08,634
Project Player.So.

4
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:12,484
It's very straightforward. You have 

5
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:15,174
open, exit, you play and stop 

6
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,714
toggle errors. What this will do is if 

7
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:20,924
there's an error in the code.This will 

8
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:23,934
toggle if you want to see it or not. So 

9
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,244
on and off. This is the version and this 

10
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,934
is the language.This is.

11
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:32,114
You can either show the console space 

12
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:34,154
plus console or space.

13
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:38,074
But you can also just use this to move 

14
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,734
it around. This will show the author and 

15
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:42,464
company and this right here will show 

16
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:43,634
the.Um.

17
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:47,384
Show the file directory. So let's open a 

18
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:47,864
file.

19
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:51,764
Open.

20
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:55,894
Let's open this one.

21
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,574
And play it.So this is a.

22
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,534
It's not a console game, so we'll put it 

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,984
right here.This is something I 

24
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:07,394
made. Um.

25
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,114
Just put a name.Play it.

26
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:16,574
There's nothing really.

27
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:20,724
Pretty much the entire thing. There's 

28
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:22,114
nothing to it.So.

29
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:26,038
That is that is it for this. Hope you 

30
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,047
learned something and.
