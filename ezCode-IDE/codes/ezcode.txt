I have created a new programming language named ezcode
it uses spaces and new lines to call and use functions
Here is a list of its functions, and the format to use them:

print text -- print (variable or any text... will only print the first word so no spaces. prints to console)
printRaw text -- printRaw (any text or sentance, will print anything after the printRaw to console)
write labelname text -- writes text (or var) to a previusly made label
writeRaw labelname text -- similar to printRaw except writes it to label instead of console
object name x -- creates and object. names it. takes a number (or var) for number of sides... 4 = rectangle, 5 = pentagon, 6 = hexagon.ect
label name -- creates a label and writes its name to its text
font labelname fontstye size -- labelname-name of label being changed. fontstyle-regular,bold,underline,ect. size - pt size (12 is usually standered)
move object/label_name x y -- self explanitory
scale objectname x y -- self explanitory
color object/label_name r g b -- colors object or font of label
await miliseconds -- 1000 is 1 second
var name value -- creates a variable (number or text), gives it a name and value. also the value can be (ConsoleInput(waits for user to send input through the console), Random min max, KeyInput, AwaitKeyInput(awaits for the user to press a key), MousePosition, MouseClick(0 is nothing, 1 is left, 2 is right, 3 is middle), ReadFile PathToFile(can also use ~/filename.ending if it is in the same directory) FromList listname index(or var))
varRaw name value -- same as var but will not set value to a variable that has the same name as the value
varInput varname INPUT -- examples of input (Console, Key, AwaitKey, StickyKey)
varSet varname (+,-,*,/,=) value(or var) -- self explanitory but is outdated. nnow you can do the same thing without varSet before it
list new name : val1,val2,val3 -- make sure the list values are seperated by a comma with no space
list add name value -- adds a value to the list
list equals name index value -- sets a value in a list to something
list clear name -- clears a list
image objectname pathToFile(or var) imagelayout -- Sets the background image of an object to a image file. image layout is like tile or zoom (stretch, zoom, tile, center, none)
listRaw ect... -- onstead of putting list put listRaw if you don't want to worry about the list contents to be the name of a variable and then making that content the value of the variable
writeToFile varname pathtofile -- writees the value of a variable to a file (can use ~/)
endBuild -- ends the build
consoleClear -- clears console
if val1 (=,!,<,>) val2 : something... -- if statement
// -- comments
loop times(or_var) -- loops everything after it until it finds end. example:
    loop 3
    print hi
    end
      OUTPUT:
      hi
      hi
      hi
Remember, you can only have one loop per script, but you can reference another script that has a loop and therefore have multiple in one build.
if making a project, the root file has to start with 'root--'
